# Menace Improvement Proposal (MIP-5)

## Abstract
Using a Nouns DAO Structure with expanded features that focus on leveraging our artistic community and focusing on creating a proper system to support NFTs as a new asset class

## Motivation
We should this because...we need governance for voting on proposals

## Owners
Who will be owners for the project and be responsible for delivering the project

TBD

## Scope
Nouns Model: A generative PFP based on premade assets is auctioned off once a day. This NFT acts as the governance token that votes to direct the flow and purpose of the treasury and collective capital. Owners have veto power with a unanimous vote in early stages; later dissolves as further structure is strengthened 


Focuses for NFT
-Generative art based on block information
- Simple, but recognizable randomized animations. Recognizable silhouettes 
- Ai Formatted backgrounds (Georgio esque)
Raised funds are split into 80 % Treasury 5% Reflective pay for holders of NFTs/fractionalized NFTs  15% Menace Trust


We also leverage our artistic community and give them access to a system of long-term stable income 
Vetted and selected artists that are part of the Menace DAO can mint an NFT under a Menace contract, art may be whatever they please giving full creative control
Art is then taken and released, varying on frequency depending how many pieces of art are locked into the contract to be auctioned.
Raised funds are split into 80% Artist 15% Incentives program/Launchpad 5% Reflective Income to NFT holders 
Royalties on sale, 6% artist, 4% rewards to holders of NFTs in perpetuity 


A Menace Token would be the utility token that helps pair value to the Menace Trusts and allows holders to purchase fractionalized NFTs
Have an inherent system that allows people to pay for fractionalized NFTs. Holders must own a base threshold to have any governance power. People must hold Menace Token to be able to buy fractionalized NFTs 

Menace Trust: A NFT Contract that allows you to turn your NFT into a trust with further bound assets to preserve the value long-term and create a self-sustaining economy with the auctions/token being the foundation of revenue and the NFTs being regarded as a Store of Value. 
Goal, create a different and recognizable self-sustaining system that allows NFTs to be regarded as a valuable asset class that are supported by DAOs. This system should then be integrated as a new ecosystem value allowing for partnerships with Dexs where you can stake your trust for rewards in their tokens

A contract would peg the values of 1 Menace NFT, Menace LP as FTM-Menace pair and also Menace LP as Menace-Stablecoin LP  1:1:1 
One could also create a contract to back a Non-Menace NFT into a Trust by pegging it to
1:1:1:1 
Fractionalized Menace NFT – Non Menace NFT – Menace/FTM LP – Menace/StableCoin LP in equal values
Holder chooses the base value they’d like the NFT to maintain depending on the value of the backed assets 

NFTs are locked into Trusts for longevity to preserve the value of NFTs, to be used for access to a system of passive income and long term store of value 
Menace Trust Tax from NFT sales goes to buy back our token and create LP Pairs to back the value of the trust and create a self-sustaining ecosystem that supports its own MC 
Goal Gain the 5 Million TVL locked in Trusts, the necessary threshold to be eligible for the Fantom Incentives program

Menace Tokens that are bought have a 0% tax but without going through the Menace Trust the tokens preserve a 20% tax on sell that 10% goes to the Menace Trust and 10% gets reflected back to holders of the NFT 
Tokens rewarded out of the Menace Trust have a 0% tax on sell 
After a certain amount of locked in time the assets can be unpaired 
People that unpair too early burn a % of their tokens and the FTM/StableCoin from the LPs is used to buyback the tokens and create more LP to be used for the Trust program

## Resources / Compensation
Do you need funding? Do the contributors of the project need to be paid in NFTs or FTM?
