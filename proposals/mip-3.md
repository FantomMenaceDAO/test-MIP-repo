## Abstract
We need to provide roles, onboarding existing and new discord roles for members of the DAO

## Motivation
A clear and concise description of what the improvement is. What is the pain point, and how does the improvement solve it?
Currently, there is no clear identification of what guild a member is part of. 

## How this will work
The discord roles will be split into the following roles
- Governance
- Software
- Artists
- Design
- Marketing
- Investor
- Collector

Please suggest other guilds if you think it is worth it

## Owners
> List folks who are going to **owners** for the project and be responsible for delivering

@0xJuly will do it, if anyone else is interested contact July

## Resources
> Do you need funding? Do the contributors to making this improvement need to be paid in NFTs or FTM?

No
